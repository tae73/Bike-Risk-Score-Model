# Bike-Risk-Score-Model

## [Mapping cyclist activity and injury risk in a network combining smartphone GPS data and bicycle counts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457515300233)
* Affiliations:  McGill University, Montreal Health and Social Service Agency
* Highlights
  * smartphone application --> GPS cyclist trip data
  * AADB(Average Anunual Daily Bicycle) from GPS data (extraplation of short- and long-term count data)
  * Bayesian prediction of injuries and risk at all intersections and segments (?)
  * Maps bicycle activity and risk for the entire network of intersections and segments (?)

* Objective
  * Estimate and map bicycle volumes and cyclist injury risk throughout the entire network of road segments and intersections
  * on the iland of Montereal, 
  * achieved by combining smartphone GPS traces and count data

*Summary
  * Combine short- and long-term bicycle counts with GPS data to estimate AADB volumes along sgments and intersections in the entire network
  * Calibration of safety performance functions using both sources of AADB estimates, from counts and from GPS data
    * --> AADB volume 예측은 공유 서비스에서나 관심있을 듯
  * Factors associated with injury risk <-- entire population of intersections and segments throughout Montreal
  * Bayesian injury risk maps / concentraitions of expected injuries and risk at signalized intersections
